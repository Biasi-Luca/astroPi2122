## Abstract

The idea is to photograph with the infrared camera an area with the  presence of vegetation. Then get the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) of that area. After that these photographs have been generated, we can compare them with other previous infrared images. By making this comparison we can understand if in the years there has been a growth or a reduction in the amount of vegetation present in that area, and so we can value the environmental impact.

## Hardware

* Raspberry PI 4
* The optical filter. This MidOpt red filter is screwed into the HQ camera's sensor mounting to enable NDVI experiments to be performed.
* The Astro Pi IR computer allows teams investigating life on Earth to do near-infrared Earth observation photography and comes with a red optical filter to enable. measurements of plant health to be made.
